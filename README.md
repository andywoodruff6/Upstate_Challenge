# Basic Hardhat Project
### Code Challenge

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It has am ERC20 token contract, and a contribution contract. The contribution contract is designed to recieve ETH and return tokens. The contract also stores the contributions and allows for an address query to see the amount of ETH contributed. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
